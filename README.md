# Portfolio-Website-using-Flask
A portfolio website can act as an online resume. We can create one using Flask and basic front-end skills.We can add all the projects and show our skills to the world. We can show our clients this website, and theyâ€™ll be able to evaluate our skills and our work in a better way, which is very important.
